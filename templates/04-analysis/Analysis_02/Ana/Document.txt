## ðŸ§  Objective
Briefly describe the overall goal of the analysis for this project code.

Example:
To perform multi-layered integrative analysis of bulk RNA-seq and transcription factor motif data to uncover regulatory drivers of differential expression under treatment.

---

## ðŸ§ª Data Summary

- Sample size: 6 (3 control, 3 treatment)
- Data types:
  - Raw counts: featureCounts output (bulk RNA-seq)
  - Motif peaks: HOMER motif calling results
  - Reference genome: hg38
- Data sources: see `01-documentation/data_sources.txt`

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Pipelines

- Bulk RNA-seq: STAR + featureCounts â†’ DESeq2 (R)
- Motif analysis: HOMER
- Visualization: ggplot2, EnhancedVolcano, ComplexHeatmap

## ðŸ§© Sub-Analyses (Topics)

| Topic ID | Focus                           | Last Run Date | Notes                         |
|----------|----------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Topic1   | DEGs between treated vs control  | 2025-07-11    | Used DESeq2 + volcano plot    |
| Topic2   | TF enrichment in DEG promoters   | 2025-07-15    | Linked HOMER motifs to DEGs   |
| Topic3   | Network of TFs and receptors     | planned       | To be built using graph theory|

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings Summary

- 356 DEGs (FDR < 0.05), 148 upregulated in treatment
- Enrichment of AP-1 family motifs (Fos, Jun) in upregulated promoters
- Several DEGs (e.g. FOSB, JUNB) have upstream motifs enriched in CRISPR screen hits
