# Topic: Differential Expression Analysis
# Run Date: 2025-07-11
# Performed by: Ji Wang

## Objective
To identify differentially expressed genes between treated and control samples using DESeq2.

## Key Settings
- Normalization: median-of-ratios
- Filtering: genes with >=10 counts in at least 2 samples
- P-adjust method: Benjamini-Hochberg
- FDR cutoff: 0.05

## Output Files
- DEG list: results/deseq2_results.tsv
- Volcano plot: figures/volcano_plot.pdf
- PCA plot: figures/pca_plot.pdf

## Notes
Rerun needed if filtering or contrast groups change.
